    // one in the array. it shows 1, but the actual element is text: Super good, id: 823423
    // if you change 823423 to 1823423, it will show the index as -1. things that are not in the array are -1. however, when 
    // you splice this at line 143, it treats the -1 as the length of the array and removes the last item which isn't what 
    // you want. after the splice is done on line 143, the console table will show the original array with the last item missing.


    // to remove it, you can use splice. what splice does is it starts at the index you give it and the second parameter is how many 
    // items to delete. if the second param is 1, then you just delete the single item starting at the index number you gave it.
    // if the second param is 2, then you delete 2 items starting at the index number you gave it.

    // gave it and then deletes however many items is indicated by the second parameter
    console.log('this is after the removal of an item on the same array');
    console.table(comments); // easier to read bc table format

    // before the splice, the comments array had 5 items counting from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. now that item 1 is removed, the new 
    // array shows 4 items and it still counts 0, 1, 2, 3. we removed item 1 which was text: Super good, id: 823423. now that it is
    // gone, the new number 1 is text: 'You are the best', id: 2039842. this new number 1 used to be number 2 and bc of the splice,
    // everything shifted over one position.

    // for lines 119 to 146, that takes the original array and removes an item and then shows the original array again but now
    // the array has one less item. it is using splice. this is different from the ex below at line 163. bc the below ex is 
    // using two arrays. the original with 5 items. and a new array with 4 items. the ex above at line 119 is doing the work 
    // on the same array.

    // the below is adding a new step where you have your original array and when you remove the item, you will get a different 
    // array that doesn't include the item that was removed. this way you can refer to the original array and the new array. 
    // the below is using slice instead of splice. also notice the ... 
    // that is spread syntax

    // you sliced to become an array item so you can iterate through them with loops and other loop-like methods. if you didn't

      // 1. the end result is just the 0. this 0 is your first item of the new array.
      ...commentsUsingSpread.slice(indexSpread + 1) // here there is no end which means it starts at the indexSpread + 1

    // if you change 823423 to 1823423, then the slice results are very similar to the splice results when you used -1 to experiment
    // with splice and -1. at line 188, the slice(0, indexSpread) is 0 at the starting point. and -1 the end point which is
    // the length of the original array. bc the end point is not included in the slice, it will take items 0, 1, 2, 3 only. 
    // and 4 is left out bc that is the end of the array. so the new array will show 0, 1, 2, 3 and then line 191 will show
    // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 which is the original array items. so the new array will be much longer than the original array. 
    // the reason line 191 is taking the entire original array items is bc slice(indexSpread + 1) is -1 + 1 which equals 0. 
    // 0 is the start point of the original array and bc there is no 2nd parameter, there is no end point of the original 
    // array so it grabs everything.
