      // the if statement is doing some math to see if there is a person 19 years or older

    // array meet the criteria.

    });

    console.log(alsoComment);

    // Array.prototype.findIndex()
    // Find the comment with this ID
    // delete the comment with the ID of 823423

    // to delete an item from an array, you need to find the position of that element. that is what findIndex does. it gives you 
    // the index number. with the index number, you can then remove that item from the array.

    // one in the array. it shows 1, but the actual element is text: Super good, id: 823423

    // to remove it, you can use splice. what splice does is it starts at the index you give it and the second parameter is how many 
    // items to delete. if 1, then you just delete the single item starting at the index number you gave it. if 2, then you 
    // delete 2 items starting at the index number you gave it.

    console.log('this is before the removal of an item');
    console.table(comments);
    
    comments.splice(index, 1); // here it will just delete the one item. if 2 or 3 etc, then it starts at the index number you 
    // gave it and then deletes however many items is indicated by the second parameter
    console.log('this is after the removal of an item');
    console.log(comments); // this shows the objects but it is collapsed and you need to expand them in the console
    console.table(comments); // easier to read bc table format

    // before the splice, the comments array had 5 items counting from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. now that item 1 is removed, the new 
    // array shows 4 items and it still counts 0, 1, 2, 3. we removed item 1 which was text: Super good, id: 823423. now that it is
    // gone, the new number 1 is text: 'You are the best', id: 2039842. this new number 1 used to be number 2 and bc of the splice,
    // everything shifted over one position.
